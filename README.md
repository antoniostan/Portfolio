# Portfolio
Portfolio containing projects that use front-end programming languages and certifications for programming contests and courses.


Projects 1-4 are simple landing pages created while I was studying front-end development.
Project 5 is a web application built for my final laboratory assignment in Introduction to Web Development in college that uses a log-in/registration system. I am currently working to switch to ExpressJS for a more modern approach.
Project 6 is a short C++ game that I made as part of a course that taught me how to use C++ paired with Unreal Engine. After finishing this course I made a little game which I used in order to get my programming certificate in 12th grade. Since this game is too big to upload on GitHub, I will leave a link to it to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xzCRvgt7KK9UP5bXwrKH4N3eyHuWJE7X/view?usp=sharing
The 'Certificates' folder is there to show what other courses/contests I participated in and other extras like volunteering work.
