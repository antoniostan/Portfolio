# Portfolio
Portfolio containing projects that use front-end programming languages and certifications for programming contests and courses.


Projects 1,3,4 are simple landing pages created while I was studying front-end development.

Project 4 was made as a side 'hustle' during summer break and it's a full front-end ecommerce website that uses a single product.

Project 5 is a web application built for my final laboratory assignment in Introduction to Web Development in college that uses a log-in/registration system. I am currently working to switch to ExpressJS for a more modern approach.

Project 6 is a short C++ game that I made as part of a course that taught me how to use C++ paired with Unreal Engine. After finishing this course I made a little game which I used in order to get my programming certificate in 12th grade. Since this game is too big to upload on GitHub, I will leave a link to it to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xzCRvgt7KK9UP5bXwrKH4N3eyHuWJE7X/view?usp=sharing

'Userhelp' is a project made within the internship program at 1&1 Internet Developer. It is a webapp that consists in a search system that returns to the user relevant html pages related to the help it needs.
The project utilizes Elastic Search in order to search through html pages situated in the elastic cluster. The pages were uploaded to an elastic cluster by a script made in python (elasticcluster).

The 'Certificates' folder is there to show what other courses/contests I participated in and other extras like volunteering work.
